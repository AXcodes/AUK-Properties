                      <p>This blog post informs property and letting owners the Updates this summer 2021.</p>
                      <hr>
                      <p>Like every June, this year’s hot month is greeting us with several significant changes in property and lettings law.</p>
                      <blockquote>
                        <p>Let me break it down for you to highlight the crucial information and explain how the upcoming changes will affect tenants, landlords and agents.</p>
                      </blockquote>
                      <ol>
                        <li>The Leasehold Reform Bill will ban ground rent for flat owners - making them pay just a peppercorn each year, in England and Wales. 
                            However, it will only apply to new buyers of new-builds - meaning 4.5million leaseholders in England and Wales will still be liable for the costs. 
                            Let’s be honest, partial ban is better than non. Hopefully it will allow the landlords to charge lower rents to benefit tenants of newly build apartments.
                        </li>
                        <blockquote>
                        <li>The Covid Bailiff ban has ended 1st of June, which means that unless tenants have Covid symptoms, tested positive or self isolating, they can be evicted with 2 weeks notice of eviction date. 
                            Previously mentioned covid issues can only prolong the eviction by another two weeks. Section 21 currently requires 4 months notice. 
                            The vast amount of tenants that had been taking advantage of Covid exceptional regulations will now have to face bailiffs and landlords will be able to repossess their properties faster, however, it is likely that Bailiffs will hear the word ‘’Covid’’ very often.
                             I always advise any tenants in arrears to work out a payment plan with their landlords, even during the court proceedings. Payment plan can be combined with an agreed move out date. 
                             Eviction court judgment on your file can make it impossible for you to rent, purchase a car, take a loan etc for years to come! 
                        </li>
                        </blockquote>
                        <blockquote>
                        <li>UK Government's new Model Tenancy Agreement puts landlords in a position of the party that needs to explain why pets would not be allowed in their property rather than the pet ban being a default clause. 
                            If the landlord does not wish pets living in their property, one must object in writing within 28 days of a written pet request from a tenant and provide a good reason. 
                            However, it shouldn’t be difficult to justify strict approach towards pets. Costly furniture, all over carpets, neighbours with allergies or poor sound proofing between the apartments can be used to justify landlord’s refusal to allow pets. 
                        </li>
                        </blockquote>
                        <blockquote>
                        <li>
                            From 1st of June, Help to Buy Scheme will be available only to First Time Buyers.
                            If you are not one and still going through motions of sale you need to be released from the transaction by the developer or reapply through the news  scheme. 
                            This change can cause many properties going back onto the market so I encourage buyers to have another browse in search for the properties they have previously inquired about!
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            Another money maker for the agents and contractors has been introduced! Now Electrical Safety Test also known as EICR (Electrical Installation Condition Report) became mandatory and one every 5 years is required for all residential properties. 
                            Risk of £30k fine will help the agents to have the landlords on board with their pricing inclusive of commission for arranging one. Cost? £99.00 to £169.00 
                        </li>
                        </blockquote>
                        <blockquote>
                        <li>
                            Lifetime deposits also known as Deposit Passporting is to be introduced once new Renter’s Reform Bill becomes live. It will allow transferring deposit from previous tenancy to the new contract without wait of it being paid out by previous landlord.
                            Sounds great doesn’t it? You pay once and you just simply move from place to place any time you crave a change. However, from the agents and landlords point of view it doesn’t look as appealing. 
                            Any deposit release is associated with check out reports and negotiations regarding any deductions. This process can significantly delay the moving process and more wealthy tenants might prefer to pay the new deposit traditionally to be able to settle down in the new home asap.
                            Agents are keen to find out what the government guidelines will be regarding this subject to be able to adjust their procedures to this significant shift in how deposits are received. My advise? Keep a good relationship with your landlord/managing agent or tenant as you will need to work together to take the most out of this change. 
                            End of the day, tenants want to move smoothly and landlords aim for short void periods.
                        </li>
                        </blockquote>
                        <blockquote>
                        <li>
                            New Cladding fund introduced by The Government will pay for the removal of unsafe cladding for all leaseholders in buildings over 18m. This amounts to £3.5 billion in additional funding. For leaseholders in buildings under 18m, costs will be capped at £50 per month under a loan arrangement.
                        </li>
                        </blockquote>
                      </ol>
                      <blockquote>
                      <p>The Government has also formally endorsed guidance from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors which means half a million leaseholders in blocks over 11 metres won’t need a separate EWS1 assessment to get a mortgage.</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <blockquote>
                            Four years down the line form the Grenfell Tower fire, The Government has finally stepped up and assisted with the massive issue of dangerous cladding still present in numerous buildings across the country. 
                            It is good news to those who were worried if they would be able to sell or obtain morgagde on the apartments with questionable cladding. The change is coming, but why it moves at a speed of a snail? 
                            As my Grandma says, if we’re not sure what it is about…it must be about money.

                    <blockquote>
                            Hope you enjoyed reading and taking the knowledge in. Property lettings and investing is one of the business sectors that requires constant legal updates and if you call yourself and experienced professional or knowledge seeking tenant you should constantly look for updates on both legal changes as well as market tendencies. 
                            I hope my blog will help you find all you need to know to stay on top of the game!
